*A curated list of digital tools we use, ranging from project management, to artificial intelligence, to intelligence & knowledge gathering and content management. Commented, connected, by everyone and for everyone !*

## Introduction
Hello ! We are Connie & Benjamin Chow-Petit, members of a special hacklab called [**La Myne**](https://lamyne.org).

Being a part of La Myne's community means anybody - of whatever age, knowledge, coming with an organisation or not - can learn between peers, initiate, join projects, mutualize resources and so on. Each reciprocity agreement is unique. This leads to a wide array of activities, ranging from collaborative meals to international research programs and socio-economical ventures. With these experiences there came a lot of challenges, general chaos, and many experimentations with tools.

For this second curated list, (the first one, [**Awesome Curated Tools**](https://github.com/chow-petit/awesome-curated-tools), is here) we focus on the tools we have selected to deploy for our IT framework. It represents our personal state-of-art and exploration in terms of integrated tools. They are meant to be collaborative and connected together. Key criterias in this selection are ease-of-use and low maintenance. That excluded a lot of powerful, but time-consuming and skill-dependant tools. We hope to deploy this IT framework as soon as possible, while sharing it with you.

As always, your contributions are welcome !

*Peer training sessions can be organized, so please [drop us a line](mailto://team@lamyne.org) if you want to know more !*
